Hi, I am [@josiah](https://github.com/spectr-e). 👋 I am a [Software Dev](https://linkedin.com/in/kamaujosia) and I love building products that make human life easier. 

Currently, I am refining my skills in JavaScript React and Next. Later on, I will be more of a Ruby/Go dev, so watch out! I am always open to hearing your feedback so drop me a note (or your entire GitHub wishlist) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kamaujosia). I grew up in Kenya, and live in the bubbly city of Nairobi. 

I’m also a Marvel/DC enthusiast - I know, it's only me who can be both - and I love turning that GitHub contribution graph ⬇️ more green 🟩 in my spare time.
